This repo corresponds to the manuscript: Physics-Informed Digital Twin Can Predict Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebral Vascular Regulation in Neurocritical Care Patients by Briggs et al. Here, we construct and validate a digital twin of cerebral hemodynamics that can be used to estimate cerebral vascular regulation and cerebral blood flow.
